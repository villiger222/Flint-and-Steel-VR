# vrif-mirror-integration
A sample project combining VR Interaction Framework with the Mirror Networking Library

## The latest VRIF Mirror example can be found at : http://github.com/nuonical/vrif-mirror-integration/

## Download Mirror from : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321

## Mirror Docs can be found at : https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs

## Instructions : 
1. Install Mirror from the asset store / packagemanager (link above)
2. Run the example scene and have one user host, and another join. The host will start the server and then immediately join as a client to their own server.

## Tips :
1. You can make a standalone build to act as the server to make testing easier
2. The VREmulator still works networked, so that can make testing quicker as well
